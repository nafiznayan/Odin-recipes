            <p>This best-ever potato salad is the creamiest, richest potato salad you will ever try. The secret is in the homemade dressing. I get nothing but raves every time I make this.</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Stir in milk, vinegar, and mustard. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter. Refrigerate until cool, then stir in mayonnaise.</li>
            <li>Peel and dice potatoes. Transfer to a large bowl; toss with hard-cooked eggs, onion, celery, and 1 teaspoon salt.    </li>
            <li>Stir dressing gently into the bowl of potato salad until evenly coated. </li>
            <li>Chill before serving, 3 hours to overnight.</li>
